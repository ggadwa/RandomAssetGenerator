# RandomAssetGenerator

A Java project that will generate random game assets, like 3D maps, models, bitmaps, etc.

Currently early in development.  You can run this from your java development environment,
hitting the "run" arrow on the map tab creates a map of randomly generated textures and
geometry, in an "output" folder inside the project folder.

This model is a glTF file and can be imported into your favorite modeling application
like Blender.
