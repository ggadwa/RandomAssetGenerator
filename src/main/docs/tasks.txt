- vertex connections are bad, maybe remember limb, can only connect one up (parent) and one down (any child)

- skins:
 "skins" : [ 
   {
    "inverseBindMatrices" : 4,
    "joints" : [ 1, 2 ]
   }
  ],
---> joints probably just equal to nodes?

- skeletons need to have animations on them, too (they break on animations)

- move up textures to 1024 on map/model



rendering:
- rethink this part of fragment shader, maybe get more expressive textures
    lightCol*=bump;
    lightCol=clamp(lightCol,0.2,1.0); // maybe at end after all calculations or not at all

        // finally create the pixel

    pixel.rgb=(tex.rgb*lightCol);
    pixel.rgb+=(min(metallic,1.0)*lightCol); // maybe clamp at end, or no clamp?
    if (hasEmissive) pixel.rgb+=(texture(emissiveTex,fragUV.xy).rgb*emissiveFactor);
    pixel.a=tex.a;


map
 - thread bitmap creation
 - stop getting caught on walls
 - going up ramps is sometimes broken
 - open ceiling
 - windows
 - skybox has bad uv (lines)
 - put back in decorations

bitmaps
 - gravel (like dirt)
 - computer access panels have handles?

model
 - anything with bars (like table, etc) can switch between simple cylinder + cube
 - add: chair, bed, couch, dresser, storage tank, pc (can put on desk), bookcase (books?), electrical box
 - some models need to have flags for "on wall" or "on desk, table, etc"
 - robot model needs to be chunkier
 - skeletons can build two heads
 - faces by meshes
 - animations
 - need meshscale for each end of limb
 - limb wrapping: don't do radius changes linearly, do it by sin
 - vertex snaps for humanoid, etc (find and implement: scene.snapVertexes)
 - finish junction
 - finish pipes
 - table: bars on legs
 - lab tube: extra pipes, maybe base, maybe control unit
 - humanoid / etc - more items (spikes, etc.)

all
 - need to export tangents

sound
 - random silences in monster?
