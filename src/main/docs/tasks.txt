- need to move center pnt along line with making cylinders
- model can merge meshes
- single mesh on model for now

- add upper and lower story (different textures!)
- each has a simple/complex flag (only hallways or squares or anything)
- each happens by extending two random rooms and connecting them by walking towards each x/z




- mosiac can have border
- clothes -> plaster
- combine skin into one bitmap type (monster)

- monster sound effect is bad
- more sound effects


- collisions between room small walls and platform sides
- make thing that adds additional horz/vert platforms to rooms

- need to export tangents
- figure out stairs later
- need frames in doorways to make up for missing headers and no-space walls
- equipment could have a desk?
- need a chair room?


- model
   - randomize legs (w/forceBilateral)

- bitmaps
   - metal - screws get random rotated cross or straight line
