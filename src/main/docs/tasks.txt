- map indoor
   - all decorations true/false flags
   - add catwalk decoration (2->4 changes, do x/z first, then random switch to opposite, repeat)

- humanoid
   - randomize legs + arms
   - forceBilateral flag for limbs
   - separate meshes




- map outdoor
   1 make a big square with a lot of segments
   2 give each vertex a random (x/z, then normalize) vector out from center
   3 average vectors with ones on both sides (always from original vector list)
   4 and then push them out to make outer wall

- rooms
   - do we need a fat + room (like the one with broken edges but a plus at the top

- bitmaps
   - metal - screws get random rotated cross or straight line

- decorations
   - pipes and others become secondary decorations
   - don't repeat decorations for connected rooms
   - pool decorations
   - better uv for pillars
   - connectors for pipes
