map
 - need real floors and ceilings

bitmaps
 - draw 3d rect just darkens instead of color so bricks retain their background
 - same problem above with boards
 - tile triangles need normals
 - cracked rocks need one background to start (so it wraps) and then have left and right cracks close to edges, also horizontal cracks are bad
 - gravel (like dirt)
 - glass alpha needs to be more complex, and have lines have less alpha
 - more distinct control panels pieces (keyboard)
 - make face textures 1, 2, or 3 eye

model
 - finish junction
 - finish pipes
 - table: bars on legs
 - lab tube: extra pipes, maybe base, maybe control unit
 - humanoid / etc - more items (spikes, etc.)

all
 - need to export tangents

sound
 - random silences in monster?
