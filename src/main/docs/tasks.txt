[ ] move up textures to 1024 on map/model
[ ] half globes for parts of body?


map
 - thread bitmap creation
 - stop getting caught on walls
 - going up ramps is sometimes broken
 - open ceiling
 - windows
 - skybox has bad uv (lines)

bitmaps
 - gravel (like dirt)
 - computer access panels have handles?

model
 - anything with bars (like table, etc) can switch between simple cylinder + cube
 - add: chair, bed, couch, dresser, storage tank, pc (can put on desk), bookcase (books?), electrical box
 - some models need to have flags for "on wall" or "on desk, table, etc"
 - robot model needs to be chunkier
 - skeletons can build two heads
 - faces by meshes
 - need meshscale for each end of limb
 - limb wrapping: don't do radius changes linearly, do it by sin
 - vertex snaps for humanoid, etc (find and implement: scene.snapVertexes)
 - finish junction
 - finish pipes
 - table: bars on legs
 - lab tube: extra pipes, maybe base, maybe control unit
 - humanoid / etc - more items (spikes, etc.)

all
 - need to export tangents

sound
 - random silences in monster?

- try jpackage
