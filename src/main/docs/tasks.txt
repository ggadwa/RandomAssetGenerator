--> oval draw is bad



map
 - going up ramps is sometimes broken
 - open ceiling
 - windows
 - skybox has bad uv (lines)

bitmaps
 - redo all bitmaps for textureSize for any numbers
 - blur seems bad on bigger maps
 - speed up bitmap drawing
 - hexagon has lines through it
 - gravel (like dirt)
 - more distinct control panels pieces (keyboard)
 - make face textures 1, 2, or 3 eye
 - brick walls with boards on them

model
 - vertex snaps for humanoid, etc
 - finish junction
 - finish pipes
 - table: bars on legs
 - lab tube: extra pipes, maybe base, maybe control unit
 - humanoid / etc - more items (spikes, etc.)
 - oil tank

all
 - need to export tangents

sound
 - random silences in monster?

- try jpackage
